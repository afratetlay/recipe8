          <p class="mb-3">Just like the food we eat, our list ends in the digestive system. The proteins, vitamins, minerals and the low content of saturated fat all contribute to a healthy stomach. And this, as you surely know, provides well-being. However, keep in mind that meat does not contain dietary fiber, which is also important for digestion. But then itâ€™s fortunate that chicken can be served in many different dishes, in good company with many other healthy and fiber-based ingredients!
